# Memory-Game
So It is a memory game, user has to remember the sequence of the color pattern which he/she chooses, for every correct sequence level will increase by one.
for eg- if computer chooses green color then the user has to choose green color then computer chooses blue color so the user has to remember the previous pattern it will choose green then blue color and so on.
