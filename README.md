# Memory-Game
So It is a memory game (jQuery), user has to remember the sequence of the color pattern which he/she chooses, for every correct sequence level will increase by one.
for eg- if computer chooses green color then the user has to choose green color then computer chooses blue color so the user has to remember the previous pattern, he/she will choose green then blue color and so on.
To use it just fork and clone it to your local device.
